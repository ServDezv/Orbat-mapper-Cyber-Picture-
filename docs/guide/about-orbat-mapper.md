# About ORBAT Mapper

ORBAT Mapper is a simple web application for building order of battles (ORBATs) and tracking unit location changes over
time. With ORBAT Mapper you can recreate historic battles and military scenarios in your browser. It is a tool
for anyone interested in military history (not only history buffs and armchair generals).
