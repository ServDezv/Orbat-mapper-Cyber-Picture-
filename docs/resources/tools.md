# Other tools and resources

ORBAT mapper is created by a hobbyist. If you need something more professional, or you want to create military overlays,
try some of these excellent tools instead:

- [map.army](https://www.map.army/about/en.html) - a really nice web application for drawing map overlays with symbols
  and tactical graphics.
- [ODIN open source command and control information system](https://odin.syncpoint.io/en/). Desktop application
  available on most operating systems (Electron based).
- [MGRS Mapper](https://mgrs-mapper.com/) - "operational graphics tool for junior leaders". Subscription based service.
  A limited free version is
  available.

There are not many specialized tools available for drawing ORBAT charts. Here are a few that I'm aware of:

- [Order of Battle Generator](https://www.orbatgenerator.com/). Online editor. Perfect for
  creating [Battle Order style](https://www.battleorder.org/us-orbat) charts.
- [Battle Order chart templates](https://www.battleorder.org/icons) (PNGs for use in a drawing program)
