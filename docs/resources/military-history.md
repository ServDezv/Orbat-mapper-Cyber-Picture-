# Military history

There is a staggering amount of military history content available online. Here are some resources I find interesting
and useful.

## Websites

If you are interested in WW2 history I highly recommend the
site [Project'44 the road to liberation](https://www.project44.ca/). Their [interactive
WWII web maps](https://map.project44.ca/) and [story maps](https://map.project44.ca/story-maps) are fantastic!

Another fascinating site is Dr. Leo
Niehorster's [World War II Armed Forces â€” Orders of Battle and Organizations](http://niehorster.org/). The site
is a gold mine of information.

For those who are interested in Cold War history, Hans Boersma's
site [Netherlands Armed Forces ORDER OF BATTLE 1985](https://www.orbat85.nl/) is a
real treat.

[Naval-History.net](https://www.naval-history.net/index.htm) contains a wealth of information about the history of the
Royal Navy. The site also contains an online
version of Gordon Smith's
book [BATTLE ATLAS of the FALKLANDS WAR 1982 by Land, Sea and Air](https://www.naval-history.net/NAVAL1982FALKLANDS.htm).
This book is used as one of
the sources for ORBAT mapper's main demo scenario.

The [Battle Order](https://www.battleorder.org/) website contains a wealth of in-depth content about ORBATs, TO&Es,
tactics, logistics and more.
